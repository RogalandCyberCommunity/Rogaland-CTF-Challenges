# Welcome to our community CTF challenge repository!

This repository is a collection of CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges created by members of the Rogaland cybersecurity community. Our aim is to create a fun and educational way to learn and explore cybersecurity concepts while fostering a sense of community among like-minded individuals.

We encourage you to fork this repository and contribute your own challenges by creating a pull request. We are always looking for new and creative challenges to add to our collection.

To get started, simply clone the repository and start exploring the challenges. Each challenge includes a README file with instructions on how to solve the challenge. If you get stuck or have any questions, feel free to reach out to the community for help.

We are constantly working on creating new challenges and expanding our community, so stay tuned for updates and join us in the quest for cybersecurity knowledge!
